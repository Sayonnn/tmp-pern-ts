# ---------- Stage 1: Build the React app ----------

# Use Node.js v22 as the build environment
FROM node:22 AS build

# Set working directory inside container to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json (or yarn.lock) first
# This allows Docker to cache "npm install" if dependencies don't change
COPY package*.json ./

# Install all dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the project (source code, configs, etc.)
COPY . .

# Run the Vite build → generates optimized static files in /app/dist
RUN npm run build


# ---------- Stage 2: Serve with NGINX ----------

FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy build output from Stage 1 to NGINX's default static folder
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy custom NGINX config (with SPA fallback)
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Expose port 80 so the app can be accessed in browser
EXPOSE 80

# Run NGINX in the foreground
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
